Feedback Loops is Simbe's unified framework for catching, suppressing, and resolving product-level data inaccuracies before they reach customer analytics. Feedback Loops uses an intelligent product-level audit workflow to accelerate store onboarding, reduce audit burden, and preserve trust in every metric we publish.

Two specialized flows—Feedback Loops for Out-On-Shelf and Feedback Loops for Standard Price—extend this framework to our two primary data domains: standard price exceptions and out on shelf detections.

## What Are Feedback Loops?

Feedback Loops create intelligent, automated workflows that learn from audits and customer feedback to continuously improve data quality. The system builds confidence in product-level detections by analyzing historical patterns over time.

The system maintains a running history of detection accuracy for each product, requiring multiple consistent observations (typically 3 out of 5 recent audits) before elevating a product to "confident" status. When customers report false positives, this feedback immediately triggers re-evaluation and can demote products to lower confidence levels. Product confidence is dynamic and adapts based on new information, creating a continuously improving system that builds on its past experiences.

## Key Benefits

- **Accelerated Onboarding**: New stores can go live faster with intelligent audit routing
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Automated suppression of low-confidence detections
- **Continuous Improvement**: System learns from corrections to improve future accuracy
- **Trusted Analytics**: Only high-confidence data reaches customer reporting

## How It Works

### 1. Detection & Flagging
Computer vision systems detect potential issues (price mismatches, out-of-stock items) and flag them for review.

### 2. Historical Confidence Assessment
The system evaluates each detection against the product's historical performance, including past audit outcomes and customer feedback patterns.

### 3. Intelligent Routing
Based on confidence levels built from historical data, the system automatically routes low-confidence items to human auditors while allowing high-confidence detections to bypass review.

### 4. Continuous Learning & Feedback Integration
Every audit outcome and customer feedback is recorded and integrated into the product's confidence history, creating a continuously improving system that builds on its past experiences.

## Two Main Workflows

### [Feedback Loops for Out on Shelf](/internal/services/feedback-loops/out-on-shelf)
Manages shelf availability detections by tracking product-level accuracy. Products start in "review" status during onboarding and graduate to "confident" status after demonstrating consistent accuracy (3/5 recent audits are accurate). The system continuously learns from user feedback and audit corrections to improve detection quality.

### [Feedback Loops for Standard Price](/internal/services/feedback-loops/standard-price)
Handles price discrepancy exceptions, enabling teams to suppress incorrect pricing data from reporting and analytics.

## Getting Started

To use Feedback Loops in your stores:

1. **Enable Services**: Add the appropriate Feedback Loops services to your store configuration
2. **Train Your Team**: Ensure auditors understand the new workflow and tools
3. **Monitor Performance**: Use the available dashboards to track system performance and improvements
