description: 'Learn about Feedback Loops for Standard Price exceptions and how to suppress incorrect pricing data from reporting and analytics'
---

The Feedback Loops - Price flow enables teams to suppress incorrect pricing data from reporting and analytics, reducing noise and increasing trust in price discrepancy reporting.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable the Service">
  Add FEEDBACK_LOOPS_PRICE to the list of enabled services for the store or retailer in your configuration. This activates price exception workflows across Simbe.ai and the mobile app.
  
  <Info>
  FEEDBACK_LOOPS_PRICE can be added at the store or retailer level.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Flag False Positives">
  Users can flag false positives using the Simbe mobile app OR web-based task reports. These are cases where a detected standard price doesn't match the standard price data ingested from the retailer.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Exceptions">
  Flagged products appear in the Product Exception Management table (Retailer > Store > Feedback Loops Tab). Each entry includes:
  
  - Product ID
  - Scene
  - Expected price when the tag was detected
  - When reporting suppression started
  - Exception type
  
  <Info>
  Currently available exception types:
  - **Price Change**: Suppression remains active unless a retailer uploads a new price
  - **Permanent Change**: Requires users to manually remove suppression
  
  All exceptions can be removed by clicking the "X" button.
  </Info>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Exception Types

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Price Change">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permanent Change">

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Exception Management Table

**Navigation Path**: Retailer > Store > Feedback Loops Tab

**Table Columns**:
- Product ID
- Scene
- Expected price when detected
- Reporting suppression start date
- Exception type
- Action buttons (remove exception)

### Dashboard Integration

<Info>
The following dashboard can be used to monitor the volume of pricetags that are suppressed from reporting.

<Card title="Price Exception Dashboard" icon="chart">
  Monitor the volume and trends of price exceptions across your retail network.
  
  **Metrics tracked**:
  - Total exceptions by store

## Best Practices

### Exception Management

1. **Regular Review**: Schedule weekly reviews of the Feedback Loops table to ensure exceptions are current
2. **Data Validation**: Verify that flagged exceptions are truly false positives before suppression
3. **Resolution Tracking**: Monitor how long exceptions remain active and follow up on long-standing cases
4. **Team Training**: Ensure all users understand the difference between Price Change and Permanent Change types

### Service Configuration

</Warning>

- **Store-level**: Enable for individual stores during initial setup or troubleshooting
- **Retailer-level**: Enable across all stores for consistent price exception handling
- **Service Dependencies**: Ensure price data ingestion services are functioning properly
