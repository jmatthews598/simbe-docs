## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    
    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Start the preview server">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!
    
    <Tip>Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Git workflow

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Clone the repository">
    To get started with the documentation repository on your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-docs-repo.git
    
    # Navigate to the project directory
    cd your-docs-repo
    
    # Check the current branch
    git branch
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="code-merge" title="Make and commit changes">
    When you're ready to make changes to your documentation:
    
    ```bash
    # Create a new branch for your changes
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    
    # Make your changes to the documentation files
    # (edit .mdx files, add images, etc.)
    
    # Stage your changes
    git add .
    
    # Commit your changes with a descriptive message
    git commit -m "Add new documentation section"
    
    # Push your branch to the remote repository
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Create a pull request">
    After pushing your changes:
    
    1. Go to your GitHub repository
    2. Click "Compare & pull request" for your branch
    3. Add a description of your changes
    4. Request review from team members if needed
    5. Merge the pull request once approved
    
    <Tip>Use descriptive commit messages and pull request titles to help your team understand the changes.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install our GitHub app">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="palette" title="Update your site name and colors">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 4: Go live

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Publish your docs">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>
