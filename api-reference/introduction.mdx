description: 'API for exchanging product, retail, and inventory data with Simbe'
---

The Simbe Cloud Partner API enables retailers and integration partners to exchange product, retail, and in-store inventory data with Simbe's platform. It is designed to support two-way communication:

- **Push Data to Simbe** – Retailers provide product, retail, and sales data to improve the accuracy of shelf and inventory insights.
- **Pull Data from Simbe** – Partners retrieve inventory records, pricing, and detection results collected by Tally robots during store traversals.

The API is RESTful, JSON-based, and secured with JWT-signed requests. Additionally, partners may subscribe to webhooks to receive real-time notifications when scans complete, enabling immediate access to updated inventory data.

## Key Features

  <Card title="JWT Authentication" icon="shield-check">
    Each API call must be signed with a short-lived JSON Web Token (HS256). Tokens are single-use and tied to the request path and timestamp, ensuring secure and tamper-proof communication.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-Time Webhooks" icon="bolt">
    Simbe Cloud can POST JSON notifications to partner endpoints when scans complete: SCENE_COMPLETED and TRAVERSAL_COMPLETED events with inventory URIs for immediate data access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Ingestion" icon="upload">
    Submit product and sales data at either the store or retailer level via upload endpoints. Data may also be exchanged via flat files over SFTP.
