## What It Does & Benefits

Feedback Loops for Standard Price enables store teams to flag false positives on pricing issues directly in the mobile app or web-based task reports. When feedback is submitted, those items are automatically suppressed from future reporting.

### Key Benefits

- **Reduced Alert Fatigue**: False positives are automatically suppressed from future reporting
- **Improved Trust**: Cleaner, more actionable pricing insights
- **Better Metrics**: Suppressed items don't count toward pricing metrics
- **Eliminated Repeat Tasks**: No more duplicate alerts for known false positives

## How It Works Behind the Scenes
